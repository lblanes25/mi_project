**Weekly Average:** 12.1 Lead hrs/week, 9.1 TM hrs/week, 2.4 L1 hrs/week

### 15-Week Compressed Timeline

Compress by:
- Overlapping stakeholder meetings with testing completion
- Condensing reporting phase by 1 week
- Increasing weekly hours by ~15%

## Reconciliation to Target (600-700 hours)

**Base Framework:** ~400 hours
**To reach 600-700 hours, add:**

1. **Higher complexity multipliers:**
   - Complex process area: 1.2x = 480 hours
   - New team members: +30-50% = 550-600 hours
   
2. **Additional scope elements:**
   - More analytics (7-8 vs 5): +30-40 hours
   - Larger sample size (60 vs 40): +30 hours
   - More complex controls (25 vs 15): +40-50 hours
   - Additional stakeholder coordination: +20-30 hours

3. **Typical "Full Scope" Horizontal:**
   - Base: 400 hours
   - Complexity (1.2x): +80 hours
   - New team member: +120 hours
   - Additional scope: +50-100 hours
   - **Total: 650-700 hours**

## Key Success Factors

1. **Analytics Efficiency:** Having experienced team member on analytics saves 20+ hours
2. **Meeting Coordination:** Clustering the 15 stakeholder meetings saves transition time
3. **Workload Balance:** Clear division between Lead and TM prevents bottlenecks
4. **Workbook Management:** Automated macros for splitting critical for efficiency
5. **Early L1 Engagement:** Prevents late-stage rework during reporting

## Usage Notes

- Analytics can be most variable component - track actuals carefully
- Stakeholder availability often drives timeline - build in flexibility
- Workbook splitting seems minor but is critical path for meetings
- Team member analytics experience is highest-impact staffing decision
- Consider scheduling retrospective before final report for immediate improvements
- L1 hours concentrate in planning and reporting phases - plan their capacity accordingly

  - Report Meeting with VP/L1 (2 hours)
  - Addressing Comments (3 hours)
  - Administrative (2 hours)
- **L1 Activities:**
  - VP review process support (6 hours)
  - PGA review process support (4 hours)
  - Meeting participation (2 hours)

#### Administrative/Coordination = 18 Lead Hours / 9 L1 Hours
- **Lead:** 
  - General administrative (10 hours)
  - Weekly VP status meetings (6 hours over 12 fieldwork weeks)
  - Stakeholder coordination (2 hours)
- **L1:** 
  - Administrative support (3 hours)
  - Weekly VP status meetings (6 hours over 12 fieldwork weeks)

### Variable Components: QA Fieldwork Phase

#### Base QA Fieldwork = 115 Lead Hours / 50 L1 Hours

**Core Testing Activities:**
- **Walkthroughs:** 8-10 hours (1-2 walkthroughs × 4-6 hours each)
- **Control Testing:** Variable based on RCM size and complexity
- **Findings Investigation:** Variable based on issues identified

**Control Testing Calculations:**

**Step 1: Determine Controls to Test**
- Small RCM (≤20 controls): Test ~50%
- Medium RCM (21-40 controls): Test ~35%
- Large RCM (>40 controls): Test ~25%

**Step 2: Calculate Testing Hours**

*Transaction-Based Controls (with sampling):*
- Simple: 2-3 hours per control
- Medium: 4-5 hours per control
- Complex: 6-8 hours per control

*Inquiry/Observation Controls:*
- Simple: 1-1.5 hours per control
- Complex: 2-3 hours per control

*Automated Controls:*
- All types: 1-2 hours per control (sample of 1)

**Step 3: Add Findings Investigation Time**
- Verbal findings: 1-2 hours each
- Low risk findings: 2-4 hours each
- Assume 20-30% of tested controls will have findings

## Estimation Formula

### Example Calculation - Medium Complexity Operational Review

**Assumptions:**
- 30 control RCM (medium size)
- Medium risk entity
- Mix of control types
- Experienced team

**Controls to Test:** 30 × 35% = 11 controls
- 6 transaction-based (medium complexity): 6 × 4.5 = 27 hours
- 3 inquiry/observation: 3 × 1.5 = 4.5 hours
- 2 automated: 2 × 1.5 = 3 hours
- **Subtotal:** 34.5 hours

**Findings Investigation:** 
- Assume 3 findings (2 verbal, 1 low risk)
- 2 × 1.5 + 1 × 3 = 6 hours

**Walkthroughs:** 2 × 5 = 10 hours

**Total Fieldwork:** 34.5 + 6 + 10 = 50.5 hours

### Multipliers
- **New QA Team Member:** 1.3x on all Lead hours
- **High Risk Entity:** 1.2x on control testing hours
- **Complex Process Area:** 1.15x on fieldwork hours

**Weekly Average:** 11.1 Lead hrs/week, 5.3 L1 hrs/week

## Budget Reconciliation

### Target: 250 Total Hours

**Framework Base Estimate:**
- Fixed Components: 55 Lead + 35 L1 = 90 hours
- Variable Fieldwork (medium example): 115 Lead + 50 L1 = 165 hours
- **Total Base:** 255 hours

**Calibration Factors:**
- Smaller/simpler reviews: -15% to -20%
- Larger/complex reviews: +15% to +25%
- New team members: +30% on Lead hours

## Key Differences from Comprehensive Reviews

1. **QA performs control testing** vs reviewing audit testing
2. **RCM-based scoping** vs workpaper coverage
3. **Walkthroughs required** with senior stakeholders
4. **Longer fieldwork phase** (9 weeks vs 4 weeks)
5. **Higher total hours** (250 vs 120)
6. **Extended timeline** (15 weeks vs 12 weeks)

## Usage Notes

- Control mix assumptions: 60% transaction-based, 25% inquiry/observation, 15% automated
- Include weekly VP status meetings in both roles' time
- Walkthrough prep time is critical for senior stakeholder meetings
- Consider stakeholder availability when scheduling walkthroughs
- Finding rates typically higher in operational reviews (QA as first line)
- L1 involvement heavier in planning (test plan review) and reporting phases

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: High-Risk Audit, Experienced Team
- **18 workpapers, high risk, experienced QA lead**
- **Controls to test:** ROUNDUP(18 × 0.30) = 6 workpapers
- **Complexity:** High = 3.5 hours per workpaper
- **Control testing:** 6 × 3.5 = 21 hours
- **Total Estimate:**
  - Lead: 38 + 55 = **93 hours**
  - L1: 24 + 15 = **39 hours**
  - Total: **132 hours**

### Example 2: Medium-Risk Audit, New QA Lead
- **10 workpapers, medium risk, new QA lead**
- **Controls to test:** ROUNDUP(10 × 0.30) = 3 workpapers
- **Complexity:** Medium = 2.5 hours per workpaper
- **Control testing:** 3 × 2.5 = 7.5 hours
- **New team multiplier:** 1.3x on Lead hours
- **Total Estimate:**
  - Lead: (38 + 55) × 1.3 = **121 hours**
  - L1: 24 + 15 + training overhead = **45 hours**
  - Total: **166 hours**

## Key Planning Constraints

### Timeline Milestones (Client-Facing)
- Announcement Memo (Day 3)
- Client Kick-Off (Day 4) - Optional
- Sharing Preliminary Results (Day 23)
- Preliminary Closing Meeting (Day 28)
- Draft Report to Client (Day 40)
- Closing Meeting (Day 42)
- Final Report Issuance (Day 55)

### Team Capacity Considerations
- L1 reviewers work on multiple reviews simultaneously
- Compressed timeline requires 58% more hours per week
- New team members require additional oversight
- Report review cycles require 2-3 day turnarounds

### Current Budget vs Framework
- **Current Budget:** ~120 hours total
- **Framework Base:** 129 hours total (93 Lead / 36 L1)
- **Framework accounts for:** Realistic L1 involvement, control complexity, team experience

## Usage Notes
- Round up workpaper calculations (can't review 0.2 of a workpaper)
- Control complexity includes research time for issues/concerns
- L1 hours are heavily back-loaded in reporting phase due to executive interface
- Framework designed for calibration as actual time tracking data becomes available
